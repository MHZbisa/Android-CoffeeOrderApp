    <string name="about_text">This application simulates a Coffee Shop. As easy as it looks like, it is pretty straight forward to implement.
        \n\n So, when a new customer walks into a shop, the attendee asks for their initial credentials which when they visit again need
        not to be produced again-instead, they can only present limited resources to validate them within their database which the shop made
        on their first appearance. \n\n I have tried my best on making this app easy to debug and extend, hence it\'s source code is available on GitHub.
        \n\n If you find a bug somewhere, please create a PR so that I can approve and merge the changes you made. \n\n\nThanks for stopping by!</string>
